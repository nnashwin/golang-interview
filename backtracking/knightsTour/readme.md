# Knight's Tour
> Classic backtracking problem.  It's even number one on [geeks for geeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/the-knights-tour-problem-backtracking-1/)

## Problem Statement 
From Wikipedia:
A knight's tour is a sequence of moves of a knight on a chessboard such that the knight visits every square exactly once. If the knight ends on a square that is one knight's move from the beginning square (so that it could tour the board again immediately, following the same path), the tour is closed; otherwise, it is open.[1][2]

The knight's tour problem is the mathematical problem of finding a knight's tour. Creating a program to find a knight's tour is a common problem given to computer science students.[3] Variations of the knight's tour problem involve chessboards of different sizes than the usual 8 × 8, as well as irregular (non-rectangular) boards.
