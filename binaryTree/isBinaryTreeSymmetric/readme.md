# Is a Binary Tree symmetric?

## Problem Definition

Symmetric Tree (Mirror Image of itself)

Given a binary tree, check whether it is a mirror of itself.

For example, this binary tree is symmetric:

     1
   /   \
  2     2
 / \   / \
3   4 4   3

But the following is not:

    1
   / \
  2   2
   \   \
   3    3
